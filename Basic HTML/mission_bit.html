		<h1>The Company</h1>

		<p><strong>Mission Bit</strong> is a non-profit organization trying to <em>eliminate the tech divide</em> in San Francisco by offering free programming classes to SFUSD students. With an emphasis on project based learning, we move towards creating a final project that showcases both the skills developed over the course of the semester and a practical representation of what those skills can become.</p>

		<h3>This Course</h3>

		<ul>
			<p>Over the course of this semester we will learn how to utilize:</p>

			<img src = "css.png">
			<p>CSS, a basic way to improve the presentation of a website.</p>
			<img src = "javascript.jpg">
			<p>JavaScript, the default programming language of the internet.</p>
			<img src = "phaser.png">
			<p>And Phaser, a JavaScript game framework.</p>
			<p>By the end of the semester, all these skills will culminate in a final group project. Examples from last semester can be found here.</p>
